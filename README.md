# xkcdpwa

Ok, what's behind this seemingly random concatenation of characters?

This repo should serve as an e2e example to implement a PWA.

And since I really like Randall Munroe's comics, we're building an XKCD viewer.

## Slides

I also prepared some slides which will be updated on the fly.

You can find them [here](https://s1hofmann.github.io/pwa/).
